Turn on blue light schedule: 
1. Rename ".blf_" in .tmp_update/config to ".blf". If it doesn't exist, create an empty file named ".blf".
2. Configure schedule by changing the time in files "blueLightTime" and "blueLightTimeOff" in .tmp_update/config/display.

Notes:
- Set correct time in Apps -> Clock.
- Schedule only works for Miyoo Mini V4 with RTC.
